Click the “Get Directory” button and navigate to the folder you want and select OK.
You must enter an extension in the Old Extension field, if you want to only change one file type. For example enter 
“txt” to select only files with that extension, otherwise you will rename all files in that folder. 

Prefix Field:
You can enter a prefix for the filename to be inserted at the beginning of the filename. You can prefix files with a 
project name, or company name, or if you are editing a folder created by uploading images from a camera you can 
prefix them with a date or event name. If you check the sequential numbering checkbox, you could enter things like 
“Part” and the files will be numbered as Part 1, Part 2, etc. You could also use prefixes like Tutorial, Volume, and 
Chapter etc.
Text to Remove:
Enter Text to Remove from a filename in this field and nothing in the Text to Replace field if you want to remove some 
text from the filename. r
Text to Replace:
Enter text in this field if you want to remove some text and replace it with other text. You may need to include spaces 
in your replacement text.
Suffix Field:
Enter text in this field if you want to append text to the end of a file. 
Change Filenames:
Click this button when you are ready to rename your files. When using this button, extension names will be changed if 
you included them in your entries.
Change Extension:
This is the one to use if you only want to change extensions. As usual, enter the old extension to search the files, and 
enter the new extension you want the file named.
